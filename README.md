Tasks on arrays and matrices

1) matrices-task1-snail.cpp

  Copy elements from matrix MA to array A in the order of snailshell pattern.


2) matrices-task2.cpp

  Put zero in all elements of diagonals, which contain the maximal element of matrix MA.

-----------------------------

# Pointers

1) pointers-task1.cpp

  You have 3 substrings: ARNOLDI, ZLDALJN, AKPILDM. The borders of these substrings are saved in char pointer's array V. Elements of array U are pointers to start and end array V. 
  Print the identic double word of those 3 strings. If there are not any identic double word, print identic word. If there are not any identic word, print identic byte. Else, print "0".
  
  To call elements of char array arr use only int pointer's array U.


2) pointers-task2.cpp

  Sort bytes of integer number: low bytes on low address in memory.

3) pointers-task3.cpp

  Change the sign of float number using pointers and bitwise operators only.
  Double the float number using pointers and bitwise operators only.
